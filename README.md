# business-recipes
Website for a food business - selling recipes (not a real business, but created to practice Adobe Photoshop, CSS and HTML skills)

- Name of the business: 
“Southern Recipes”
- What the business does: 
Southern Recipes sells recipes of Latin American dishes, providing some special features besides the instructions, such as the use of more accessible and affordable ingredients, grocery stores near to the client, and access to professional chefs to answer questions about the recipes.
- Who is the target demographic of the business? 
Latin Americans living in the US and Latin American culture lovers in general
- How is the website going to help the business make money/be successful?: 
The first aims of the website are to create a presence and build trust with potential clients. The layout was created trying to use the minimum of information possible, but the main page works with four big elements: (1) a strong image that awakens the curiosity of the user; (2) an interesting slogan that keeps people’s attention (in special the target-public: Latin-American lovers), (3) a hyperlink leading to the products, and (4) a short description of awards that validate the quality and liability of the company. 
On the page of services (called “Recipes” on the website), there are only four products available. This small number of options was on purpose, in order to build a sense of exclusivity to the product and also to ease the users’ decision process, as there are not that many opportunities for them to get lost or confused with the product and the choices.
Concluding, the aforementioned pages contribute to consolidating the branding and capturing new clients by using direct and visual approaches.
